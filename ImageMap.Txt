Well, they said it couldn't be done.

As of version 1.20 of Mike Cowlishaw's OS/2 gopher server, GoServe, it has been
enabled to serve up HTML documents to WWW browsers at the HTTP/0.9 level.
(And it does that very well, I might add...)

Unfortunatly, however, it has appeared that it couldn't support any of the more 
advanced HTTP/1.0 functionality, such as Active Maps, Forms, etc.  Until now, 
that is...

This package provides the information & files necessary to graft support for Active 
Maps, or image maps, onto the GoServe system.


Contents of the ImageMap.Zip archive:
	ImageMap.Txt		This file
	ImageMap.80		The REXX Script which handles the imagemap function
	GoFilter.Add		File containing REXX code snippets to graft into
				GoFilter.## to allow it to recognize ImageMap.##
	conf\imagemap.cnf	A sample configuration file.


The ImageMap script was written to follow and use the same rules as the Unix-based
HTTPD servers, allowing the same setup file structures to be used.  (The exception is 
that Unix HTTPD servers use a "conf\imagemap.conf" file -- I made exception for those
OS/2 users still using FAT filesystems by using the ".cnf" extension.)  The "*.MAP" file
structure is identical to that employed by Unix HTTPD servers.

A Web-based tutorial on the setup of imagemap services can be found via the 
URL "http://wintermute.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/map-tutorial/image-maps.html"

Note:
In addition to the standard "rect" region supported by Unix-based imagemap 
systems, this one also supports the definition of "circ", or circular regions:

circ	<URL to redirect to>	{midpoint X},{midpoint Y}     {Radius}


Sometime soon, I hope to get around to putting together an on-line document 
(WWW, of course) covering the details of the REXX ImageMap system.

Look for it on my personal home-page: 
"http://gopher.ag.uiuc.edu/DLM/DLM.Html"


If you have questions on how to set this up on your server, feel free to 
contact me via email at 'dlmeyer@uiuc.edu'.
